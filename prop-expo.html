            <h3>Properties of exponents</h3>
         <p>In the product property, an expression in which two of the same bases with different exponents multiplying each other is equivalent to that base raised to the power of the previous exponents added together 
          <br>
          (b<sup>x</sup> * b<sup>y</sup> = b<sup>x+y</sup>)</p>
         <p>In the quotient property,  an expression in which two of the same bases with different exponents dividing each other is equal to the shared base raised to the power of the  different exponents dividing each other (b<sup>x</sup> / b<sup>y</sup> = b<sup>x-y</sup>)</p>
         <p>Whenever a number that isn’t 0 is raised to the power of 0, it equals 1. This is called the Zero Exponent Property (b<sup>0</sup> = 1)</p>
         <p>When a base that is being raised to a power is being powered, we rewrite it as the base being raised to the power of both original powers multiplying each other. This is referred to as the power property ( (b<sup>x</sup>)<sup>y</sup> = b<sup>x*y</sup</p>
         <p>When base of an exponent is multiplied, it is equal to the two factors raised to the original exponent multiplied by each other (ab<sup>x</sup> = a<sup>x</sup> * b<sup>x</sup> )</p>
         <p>When a fraction is raised to a power, the power is distributed to the integers that make up the numerator and denominator. Those terms then divide each other. This is known as the Quotient to a Power Property ( (a/b)<sup>-x</sup> = (b/a)<sup>x</sup> )</p>
         <p>If you have a fractional exponents oporating on your base, then it should equal to your base getting rooted by your denominator and powered by the numerator. These are called Radicals, but are also known as Rational Exponents ( b<sup>n/d</sup> = (d√b)<sup>n</sup> )</p>
