            <h3>What is algebra</h3>
            <p>Algebra is similar to arithmetic you’ve been accustomed to, where you’re probably used to seeing equations like, 2 + 3 = ____ .The key difference with algebra is that instead of leaving a blank, we put a symbol that represents that blank. That symbol is called a variable, and they are usually letters. The most common one used when solving equations is x. Variables are symbols that represent something in an equation that has an unknown value. 
            </p>
            <p>Here is the same equation rewritten so that x is in the equation. 2 + 3 = x. Because it is unknow as to what two plus three is equal to, we put the variable x as a placeholder, and must now find the value of the unknown, represented with the variable x. We can do that by adding 2 + 3, which is 5. This means that variable “x” is equal to five (x=5).</p>
            <p>Algebra can be used for other operations as well, like multiplication seen in the example, 3x = 9. You may notice that the multiplication sign “×” has been omitted. This is because multiplication is treated different in algebra because it is seen as the default operation. If you ever see *thing* sitting next to a variable, it implies that they are multiplying each other. There are two exceptions to this rule. The first is that we must write the multiplication sign when multiplying known values. The exception to this exception is that we can imply two known values multiplying each other by writing them inside parentheses like so, (3)(3) = 9.
            </p>
            <p>The division operation is another one that is treated differently in algebra. Instead of the traditional “÷” sign we write the division of two terms as a fraction, like so: ½</p>
